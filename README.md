# German Flag based on Election Results

These flags are based on the election results in the "Bundestagswahlen" every ~4 years.

It is only based on the results of the FDP, CDU, and SPD, because their colours are on the current flag of Germany.

I honestly thought I would get way cooler flags, but it is what it is.

## Flaws

These flags only represent three parties! It is not an accurate representation of the whole election results as there are several other parties that participated. Especially in later years, the earlier parties lost many voters and this can cause major inaccuracies.

 DO NOT TAKE ANY OF THESE AS ACCURATE REPRESENTATIONS OF THE ELECTION RESULTS!

## TODO

Make all flags with all other partys represented.
